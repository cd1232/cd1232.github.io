description: Exspelled is a (4 player) multiplayer game played over the LAN. This game is the 3rd year project for our group of 2 programmers, 4 artists, and 1 sound engineer. I was responsible for a lot of the player character, and dealing with the replication of things like potion throwing and dashing. I also dealt with programming some of the puzzle elements that some of our team designed.
