description: Grimder was a Ludum Dare game made in 72 hours with myself as the programmer and 3 artists. The theme for LD42 was Running Out of Space and our team came up with the idea of Death managing queues to Heaven and Hell by swiping left and right (A play on Tinder). This project was done using Unity and C#.
