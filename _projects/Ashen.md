description: Set in a sprawling open world, Ashen is a tight, 3rd person, skill-based action RPG about guiding your wanderer through a newly lit world. During my time there I began bugfixing issues in Ashen:Nightstorm Isle before it was set to release.

Most of my work at A44 was on their next project, designing a node-based conversation editor that handled dialogue between multiple characters, branching choices, and conditional nodes.
