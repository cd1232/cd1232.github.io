description: Just a Potion Seller was a game made for the Bored Pixels 8 Jam. I was the sole programmer on the team, with a game designer, sound designer/composer, and an artist. I implemented all the art in game and all the logic for ingredident-mixing to make potions, while also handling the betting and logic for what floor a hero could make it to. I made the ingredients, potions, and buffs in a designer-friendly way using Unity's Scriptable Objects. Our designer could choose to implement or change the logic for how ingredients mixed and what effect that would have on the game.
