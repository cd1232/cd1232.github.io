description: Soul Eater is a clicker game made for android over a few weeks. We looked at a couple of clicker games already on the market and tried to reproduce some of their mechanics. The main game we looked at was cookie clicker. <br/> <br/>Soul Eater features google play intergration in the form of a leaderboard and achievments. Soul Eater also runs when you're not using your phone, it does this by checking the time when it is opened again and adding those souls.
